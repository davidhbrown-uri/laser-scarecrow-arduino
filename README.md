# laser-scarecrow-arduino
For Dr. Rebecca Brown's research testing the effectiveness of laser light in preventing bird damage in sweet corn

Please look for information about this project and related resources at http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/riaes_bulletin/

I apologize that I haven't yet  been able to put the time into polishing up the code into something ready for version control and community development. As so many things do, this started as a quick hack and then grew and grew. If you're ready to get going, please email me at david_h_brown@uri.edu and I'm happy to send you a .zip of the version we used in Summer '17.

## Sparkfun Board Library
I selected the Sparkfun Pro Micro 5V/16MHz board for this project. You will need to install their board libraries from https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards

Make certain you select the 5V part both when purchasing (or it won't work for this) and when programming (or you might brick it).
